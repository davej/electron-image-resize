## API

### electronImageResize(options)

#### options

##### url

Type: `string`  
*Required*

URL of image to resize. For local paths prefix the path with '`file://`'.

##### width and height

Type: `number`  
*At Least One Is Required*

The width in pixels to resize the image to.
The height in pixels to resize the image to.
If only one dimension is provided, the image will be re-sized so that the original height/width ratio is maintained.

##### delay

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `500`

We will wait until the image is loaded but often you will need to also add a delay to give the renderer time to paint the image before capturing it.


#### Returns

Returns a promise which resolves to a [NativeImage](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/native-image.md). Use methods like `.toPng()` and `.toJpeg()` to get a buffer which you can use to write to the file system.
